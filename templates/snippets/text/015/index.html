        <p>"You Are a House"</p>
        <p>Imagine you are a house being built. It is a large house with many rooms. When the plans are drawn up it looks so magnificent and with such detail.  During its construction there are cutbacks, and days that are rained out. Many times due to these set backs, the plans have to be modified. Still the hope of creating such a master piece remains.</p>
        <p>Many areas of the construction are not that important and we know it. As we think, no one will notice the substitution with an inferior material here, no, No not here. Then once we have finished that area. Even though no one seems to see the poor work we did, we see it. Then when knowing that we tend to do less and less of a good job while building the rest. Then the House is finished, it does not look like the original plans and we remember, all the times we said, No one will notice. Someone did notice, but it was not who we thought it would be.</p>
