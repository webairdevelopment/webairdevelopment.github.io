        <p>"Jesus said"</p>
        <p>Mark 2:27<br>
          Then he said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.<br>
          This Idea here in Mark, is Not that you go to church on any certain day.</p>
        <p>John 7:39<br>
          By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.</p>
        <p>Before the Lord Jesus came and shed his blood for sin, His Holy Sprit could not live in His people. The price for their sin, was only temporarily covered by the sacrifices (as explained by God through Moses) of Israel (Abraham’s descendants). With His Sprit His children worship Him everyday and all day. He now walks and speaks with His children everywhere, One of One.</p>
        <p>1 Corinthians 12:13<br>
          For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.</p>
        <p>The Sprit is the one that will proclaim His two witnesses. God is Sprit, man is flesh. The flesh will deceive you.</p>
        <p>This is a man of flesh. His two witnesses will not need an ID or a Green Card to tell you they are of God. Be Wise, look to the Lord God Almighty not men that proclaim holiness, for None are Holy but God.<br>
          It is only by the Blood of Jesus Christ that washes away our sin.</p>
        <p>We are weak He is strong. His grace covers us when we fail (sin again), He then will chastise those He loves. He will let you know, all you have to do is hear and obey the Lord. Not man’s law, God’s law, He will let you know when no one is there but you and Him.</p>
